By sourcing `run_analysis.R` inside R evironment, data are downloaded from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#) dataset in a temporary directory. Then files are unpacked and *train* and *test* dataset are reconstructed by loading the `X_train.txt` and `X_test.txt` file; Columns were labeled with `features.txt` file for each of the dataset. Activities are merged to *train* and *test* set dataset by adding `y_train.txt` and `y_test.txt` as a new column. Subject are added in the same way by adding `subject_train.txt`  and `subject_test.txt` as a new column on *train* and *test* dataset respectiveley. Then `activity_labels.txt` was used to replace the *activity id* with its appropriate label. *train* and *test* dataset were merged by rows and only the measurements as *mean()* or *std()* where extracted. Finally a *tidy dataset* was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This *tidy dataset* was dumped in the `tidy_dataset.txt` file.
